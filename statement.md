# Problem statement 
The core problem addressed by this system is the need for a simple, reliable and user-friendly digital system to manage the fundamental operations of syllabus and portion 

The fundamental problem this system seeks to solve is the operational inefficiency and potential for error inherent in manual or legacy systems used by students  and instructor  to manage their syllabus functions.  

The goal is to provide a reliable, modular and easy-touse digital solution that enhances accuracy and student experience. 


# Scope of the project 
Smart Planner (AI):

It will become smarter. Instead of just setting fixed dates, it will look at your test scores and automatically tell you, "You are weak in Chapter 5, spend two extra days on it," and then adjust the rest of your schedule.

Connecting to Everything (Integration):

It will link up with your school's online systems (like the place where you see your grades or submit homework). When a teacher posts an assignment, the tracker updates automatically.

Better Resources:

It will stop being just text. For every topic, it will automatically suggest the best video, the right textbook page, or a practice quiz from the internet.

Teamwork and Management:

Teachers can use one system to see if all classes are moving at the same speed.

Parents could log in to see their child's progress without calling the school.

Motivation and Fun (Gamification):

It can give you badges or points for finishing chapters to make studying feel more like a game.
